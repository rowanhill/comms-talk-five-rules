          <ul>
            <li>Amazing bang for buck</li>
            <li>No matter how great you are, if you don't communicate, your customer won't know</li>
            <li>Andy T's package delivery example:
              <ol>
                <li>No comms:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Package fails to arrive Tues when you want.</li>
                    <li>Arrives Fri instead - 3 days late!</li>
                    <li>You vow to never use that delivery company again.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Good comms:
                  <ul>
                    <li>They ring you on Monday, and say it's out of stock, so will be delayed - will update on Weds</li>
                    <li>On Weds, they ring and say they've moved heaven & earth to find a supplier - will be with you on Fri!</li>
                    <li>Package arrives on Friday as promised</li>
                    <li>You're impressed by their great service</li>

              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Only difference is a couple of quick calls</li>
            <li>If it hurts, do it more: if you're scared of communicating, DO IT MORE. Bad news only festers.</li>

                <li>Overspend (even if justified)</li>
                <li>Late releases</li>
                <li>Holiday / reduced support</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To avoid surprises, you need to guarantee they know what you think they do</li>
            <li>That means being EXPLICIT, not assuming they can work it out</li>
            <li>Example: A tight support budget + lots of small tasks which we tell them the individual cost = surprise overspend</li>
            <li>Solution: Show the total spent, include projections, and explicitly tell them they're going to go over</li>

            <li>Email's good for everyday info & recording decisions</li>
            <li>Rubbish for big discussions, negotiations, scary discussions, or getting prompt info</li>
            <li>Might think email is better if you're nervous - actually, you're making it harder, as you don't get to react</li>
            <li>If you're not sure what someone's reaction will be, ALWAYS talk on phone / in person</li>
            <li>You can judge their reaction and tailor the message, and if they're angry they get to vent a bit (seriously!)</li>

            <li>That means you need to KNOW THE CORE MESSAGE - make sure it's specific. What should they know afterwards?</li>
            <li>Repeating snippets in recurring mails also turns people off - at the very least, rephrase (or chop it out!)</li>

            With that in mind, I think I would propose that we discard this concept and the corresponding set of estimates,
            and instead focus on what would be necessary for a real go-live release. That will naturally take longer,
            but we were expecting that to be a longer second phase anyway, so hopefully this doesn't come as a
            surprise. In terms of estimating this new goal, I think we probably don't yet know enough about the
            process discrepancies to be confident of any figure for an estimate for this that we might produce, but...

              Common to complain that they don't get back to us - but we send huge emails full of hard questions which
              they have to fit in around their day job, so no wonder they don't feel like making a start on it
            </li>
            <li>
              Maybe a meeting would be better? Or a (video?) call? We might get answers faster, and influence them to
              be the 'right' ones

              Even if you can't believe it, acting as if they're reasonable will keep you calm, and help you be clearer
