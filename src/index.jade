            li Series of simple rules
            li Mostly about customer communications, but transferable

        aside
          ul
            li Amazing bang for buck
            li No matter how great you are, if you don't communicate, your customer won't know
            li Andy T's package delivery example:
              ol
                li No comms:
                  ul
                    li Package fails to arrive Tues when you want.
                    li Arrives Fri instead - 3 days late!
                    li You vow to never use that delivery company again.
                li Good comms:
                  ul
                    li They ring you on Monday, and say it's out of stock, so will be delayed - will update on Weds
                    li On Weds, they ring and say they've moved heaven & earth to find a supplier - will be with you on Fri!
                    li Package arrives on Friday as promised
                    li You're impressed by their great service
            li Only difference is a couple of quick calls
            li If it hurts, do it more: if you're scared of communicating, DO IT MORE. Bad news only festers.

        h1 no suprises
        aside
          ul
            li You hate the package delivery company because they surprised you
            li Customers hate suprises too
              ul
                li Overspend (even if justified)
                li Late releases
                li Holiday / reduced support
            li To avoid surprises, you need to guarantee they know what you think they do
            li That means being EXPLICIT, not assuming they can work it out
            li Example: A tight support budget + lots of small tasks which we tell them the individual cost = surprise overspend
            li Solution: Show the total spent, include projections, and explicitly tell them they're going to go over

        aside
          ul
            li "Choose your medium carefully"
            li Email's good for everyday info & recording decisions
            li Rubbish for big discussions, negotiations, scary discussions, or getting prompt info
            li Might think email is better if you're nervous - actually, you're making it harder, as you don't get to react
            li If you're not sure what someone's reaction will be, ALWAYS talk on phone / in person
            li You can judge their reaction and tailor the message, and if they're angry they get to vent a bit (seriously!)

        aside
          ul
            li Lots of text turns people off - keep to the core message
            li That means you need to KNOW THE CORE MESSAGE - make sure it's specific. What should they know afterwards?
            li Repeating snippets in recurring mails also turns people off - at the very least, rephrase (or chop it out!)
            li A picture is worth a thousand words, and keeps people interested - burn-up charts > description
